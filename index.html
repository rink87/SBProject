		<h1>CHRIS LADOUCEUR</h1>
		<p>Growing up in the Rocky Mountains, I found an appreciation for architecture and form. I really enjoy discovering how things are put together, so when I look at a new venture, I want to embrace it and immerse myself into every aspect of the project. Hands-on and sleeves rolled up, I am learning HTML5, CSS, PHP, game engines, mobile application development, and modern cutting edge web design tools.</p>
