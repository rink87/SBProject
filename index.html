		<p style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 20px">Growing up in the Rocky Mountains, I found an appreciation for architecture and form. I really enjoy discovering how things are put together, so when I look at a new venture, I want to embrace it and immerse myself into every aspect of the project. Hands-on and sleeves rolled up, I am learning HTML5, CSS, PHP, game engines, mobile application development, and modern cutting edge web design tools.</p>
